# Seasonal Geographic Patterns in U.S. Product Returns Story 

## Overview 
*In this analysis, I explored how product returns vary by state and season, using Superstore order and return data from 2018 to 2021. The goal was to identify where and when returns are most likely, so the helping businesses make informed decisions on where and when to focus operational efforts around inventory, marketing, and product placement.
