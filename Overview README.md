Projects I worked on while attending the Data Analysis TripleTen Bootcamp.
| Project Number | Title | Description 
| :-----------: | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1 | [Fresh Beats Listener Trends and Strategic Recommendations Report](https://github.com/Gertrude-C/TripleTen_projects/tree/130e820e47b4d6408fa23d321ebb0be833e57eac/Music%20Streaming%20Product%20Report) | This report analyzes user listening trends across genres and tiers to uncover opportunities for catalogue expansion, increased engagement, and stronger free-to-paid conversion.|
| 2 | NYC Air BnB Rental Popularity & Earnings Overview (https://github.com/Gertrude-C/TripleTen_projects/tree/130e820e47b4d6408fa23d321ebb0be833e57eac/Rental%20Property%20Industry%20Report)| This project analyzes NYC vacation rental data to identify which neighborhoods and property types attract the most demand. The findings highlight a few key areas and unit sizes that consistently perform well. These insights help hosts and investors focus on the options most likely to generate strong occupancy and revenue. |
| 3 | Exploring Startup Trends with SQL (https://github.com/Gertrude-C/TripleTen_projects/blob/130e820e47b4d6408fa23d321ebb0be833e57eac/Exploring%20Startup%20Trends%20with%20SQL.pdf) | This project analyzes the educational backgrounds of employees from failed startups and calculates the average education level to uncover meaningful patterns. The findings provide clients with data-driven insight to better understand the role education may or may not play in startup success. |
| 4 | Data Visualization with Tableau (https://github.com/Gertrude-C/TripleTen_projects/tree/130e820e47b4d6408fa23d321ebb0be833e57eac/Superstore%20Analysis%20Project%20Portfolio%20Case%20Study) | This project examines the Superstore dataset to uncover the key drivers behind profit, loss, and product returns. Through targeted analysis, it identifies which product combinations are most profitable, where advertising efforts should be focused, and which items or customers contribute to high return rates. These insights support smarter merchandising, marketing, and operational decisions to help the business prevent financial decline.
| 5 | Seasonal Geographic Patterns in U.S. Product Returns Data Story (https://github.com/Gertrude-C/TripleTen_projects/tree/130e820e47b4d6408fa23d321ebb0be833e57eac/Seasonal%20Geographic%20Patterns%20in%20U.S.%20Product%20Returns%20Story)| This project explores seasonal and geographic return patterns in Superstore data from 2018 to 2021. Return rates peak in August and December, with Utah showing consistently high returns and Idaho performing more steadily. These insights support smarter inventory planning, targeted marketing, and stronger return-management strategies.
| 6 | Is the American Middle Class Disappearing? Data Jam (https://github.com/Gertrude-C/TripleTen_projects/tree/130e820e47b4d6408fa23d321ebb0be833e57eac/Data%20Jam%20Project) | This analysis examined whether the American middle class is disappearing. The findings show that the middle class is not necessarily shrinking in size, but it is under growing financial pressure. As the cost of living rises faster than incomes and income inequality increases, real purchasing power has declined, leaving the middle class more financially strained and economically vulnerable.
